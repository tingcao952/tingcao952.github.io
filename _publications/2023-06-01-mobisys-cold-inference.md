excerpt: 'Deep Neural Network (DNN) inference on edge devices often suffers from significant cold-start latency when models are first loaded or after periods of inactivity. This cold inference latency creates noticeable delays in user-facing applications and impacts the user experience. This paper presents a comprehensive approach to boost DNN cold inference performance on edge devices. By combining innovative memory management techniques, model prefetching strategies, and resource-aware scheduling, the proposed system significantly reduces cold-start latency across diverse edge devices and DNN architectures. Extensive evaluations on real-world mobile applications demonstrate substantial improvements in responsiveness without compromising inference accuracy or requiring model modifications.'
