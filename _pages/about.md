## Research

Dr. Ting Cao is a Professor at the Institute of AI Industry Research (AIR), Tsinghua University. Her research interest include Edge AI, large foundation model algorithms, AI inference systems, and novel AI accelerators. Her research works have been published in top-tier computer system conferences such as **ISCA, ASPLOS, MobiCom, MobiSys, NSDI, OSDI, PLDI, EuroSys, SC, and PPoPP**, as well as leading AI algorithm venues including **ICCV, ACL, and KDD**.

She has numerous awards, such as 2012 **ACM Research highlights**, 2012
**IEEE Micro Top Picks**, 2021 **ACM SIGMOBILE Research highlights**, and **PPoPP'24, MobiSys'21, NAS'14 and ICCD'10
Best paper awards**.

Dr. Caoâ€™s research has significantly advanced the field of AI on edge devices, making it possible to deploy complex deep neural networks and large language models directly on [consumer devices such as smartphones and PCs](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/achieving-zero-cogs-with-microsoft-editor-neural-grammar-checker/), greatly lowering Cloud operational costs. Her innovations have been integrated into products used by millions, including Microsoft Office, Windows, Bing, and Huawei HarmonyOS.

Her work has attracted considerable media attention, particularly her contributions to [low-bit and table-lookup techniques for LLM inference](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/xOaOCLu4fdpx0-IVB0UnTg), [large model accelerators utilizing commercial DRAM](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/n1ZRa0g98YGuxTKxAES_AQ), the [VLM model StreamMind for continuous video understanding](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/rGTV4zbxi-fhtOmpbRqPRw), the [near real-time GUI agent V-droid](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/GxTJrTp-gfg0N1wchpYptg), and [Cloud for Science paradigm](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/f_Qr3tNfpvSAdRbt0JFx0Q).

## Education and Work Experience

Before join Tsinghua University, Dr. Cao worked as a Principal Researcher and Research Manager at Microsoft Research, leading the Edge AI direction. Prior to that, she was with the Compiler and Programing Language lab at Huawei, and the State Key Lab of Computer Architecture at the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

She received her PhD from the School of Computing at the Australian National University, where she was honoured to be supervised by [Prof. Steve Blackburn](https:www.steveblackburn.org) and [Prof. Kathryn McKinley](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~mckinley/). Her doctoral research focused on the Software and Hardware co-design for energy efficiency. Turing Award winner Prof. David Patterson wrote a [perspective article "For Better or Worse, Benchmarks Shape a Field"](https://cacm.acm.org/research/technical-perspective-for-better-or-worse-benchmarks-shape-a-field/),  recommending her work on [quantitative energy analysis for modern software and hardware](https://cacm.acm.org/research/looking-back-and-looking-forward/) for the ACM Research Highlight, and integrated the results into the classic textbook "*Computer architecture: A Quatitative Approach*".
