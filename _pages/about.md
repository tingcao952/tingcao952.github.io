## Research

Dr. Ting Cao is a Professor at the Institute of AI Industry Research (AIR), Tsinghua University. Her research interest include Edge AI, large foundation model algorithms, AI inference systems, and novel AI accelerators. Her research works have been published in top-tier computer system conferences such as **ISCA, ASPLOS, MobiCom, MobiSys, NSDI, OSDI, PLDI, EuroSys, SC, and PPoPP**, as well as leading AI algorithm venues including **ICCV, ACL, and KDD**. She has got a range of awards, such as 2012 **ACM Research highlights**, 2012
**IEEE Micro Top Picks**, 2021 **ACM SIGMOBILE Research highlights**, and **PPoPP'24, MobiSys'21, NAS'14 and ICCD'10
Best paper awards**.

Dr. Caoâ€™s research has significantly advanced the field of AI on edge devices, making it possible to deploy complex deep neural networks and large language models directly on [consumer devices such as smartphones and PCs](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/achieving-zero-cogs-with-microsoft-editor-neural-grammar-checker/), greatly lowering Cloud operational costs. Her innovations have been integrated into products used by millions, including Microsoft Office, Windows, Bing, and Huawei HarmonyOS.

Her work has attracted considerable media attention, particularly her contributions to [low-bit and table-lookup techniques](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/xOaOCLu4fdpx0-IVB0UnTg) for LLM inference, [large model accelerators utilizing commercial DRAM](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/n1ZRa0g98YGuxTKxAES_AQ), the [StreamMind VLM model for continuous video understanding](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/rGTV4zbxi-fhtOmpbRqPRw), the near real-time [GUI agent V-droid](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/GxTJrTp-gfg0N1wchpYptg), and [Cloud for Science paradigm](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/f_Qr3tNfpvSAdRbt0JFx0Q).

## Education and Work Experience

She got her PhD from School of Computing, the Australian National University. She is honoured to be supervised by [Prof. Steve Blackburn](https:www.steveblackburn.org) and [Prof. Kathryn McKinley](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~mckinley/).
